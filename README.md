# How-Strong-is-Strong-Enough
Quantifying underlying capacities of sprint performance is useful for monitoring training and guiding interventions. 
Here, we provide a method for predicting sports performance (e.g., sprint running performance) from metrics derived from physical performance tests (e.g., isometric mid-thigh pull or dynamic squat strength). 
The code provided will train Random Forest models for predicting sprint times (dependent variable). It will evaluate model performance (i.e., how well your independent variables can predict your outcome variable). 
The code will compute Feature Importance scores, indicating the contribution of that particular variable to your outcome variable. 
Finally, the code will generate Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) which will allow you to visualise thresholds or saturation points where the independent variables begin or cease to be predictive of your outcome variable.
